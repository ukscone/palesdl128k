palesdl128k
===========

Port of Pete Todd's Camputers Lynx Emulator. The 128k (192/256) Lynx.

this is currently very messy as it's been pulled out from the Dos & Windows versions that use
fltk, sge & RAZE and lots of hacks & really messy code but it compiles and runs and
runs pretty well on the Raspberry Pi on console & ok-ish over vnc. sound is currently
iffy/non-working & the gui is very primative and a lot of things probably don't work.

cp/m & lynxdos seem to be fine.


requires libSDL1.2 & libdsk (any ver > 1.1.5) from http://www.seasip.demon.co.uk/Unix/LibDsk/
